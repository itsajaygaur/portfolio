What influences developers to adopt a product?

Trust. The tools they adopt and advocate for impact their reputation. You might have heard “no one ever got fired for buying IBM” in reference to making good choices.

But picking older, well-adopted tools can be at odds with how fast the industry moves. Is there a newer alternative that solves my needs better? Ask your developer.

Keeping up the latest trends is part of their job. They need to know what's a fad and what's here to stay. This is why experienced developers become skeptical of almost everything. It's hard to earn their trust.

Developer marketing is about building trust. Here's what's worked for me.

## How can I improve my developer marketing?

1. Don’t publish content you wouldn’t share yourself.
2. Always consider how you can build developer trust. It’s not a one-time transaction. It’s reflected in every product and marketing decision you make.
3. When something sucks with your product, own it. Don’t try to hide the failure. Lean into it. Bring the community along for the continuous iteration of your product. “You told us this was bad, and we fixed it”. Follow up with people after you ship.
4. Get involved in the community. Host, attend, or sponsor a hackathon or meetup. Spend time talking to developers 1:1. Their feedback drives product improvements _and_ content ideas. Where are people struggling? Write about that.
5. Create a [developer experience so good](/blog/developer-experience) that it does marketing for you. Write docs worth sharing, filled with helpful diagrams and detailed descriptions. Create code examples and templates that help developers get started quickly.

## Throw out the old playbook

Developers _love_ great marketing, but most companies get it wrong.

They’re trying to apply the enterprise marketing playbook to the wrong audience.

- **Enterprise Marketing**
  - **Goal**: Grow pipeline and revenue
  - **Audience**: Directors, VPs, or C-suite
  - **Buyer Interests**: Increased efficiency, cost savings, innovation
  - **How**: Sales-served, sign a yearly contract for a discount
- **Developer Marketing**
  - **Goal**: Grow retained signups and community awareness
  - **Audience**: Individual developers
  - **Buyer Interests**: Transferable skills, affordable, great developer experience
  - **How**: Self-serve, start free then swipe a credit card

## What does great developer marketing look like?

I’m a developer who [works](/work) at the intersection of engineering, product, and marketing. Based on my experience, the best developer marketing:

1. **Teaches how to build great products**
2. **Builds and retains trust**
3. **Uses precise language**
